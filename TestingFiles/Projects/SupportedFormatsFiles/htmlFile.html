<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The oldest
known religious texts are Pyramid texts of Ancient Egypt that date to
2400-2300 BCE. The earliest form of the Phoenician alphabet found to
date is the inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram of Byblos.
( The Sumerian Temple Hymns [1]). The Epic of Gilgamesh from Sumer,
with origins as early as 2150-2000 BCE,[2]:41&ndash;42 is also one of
the earliest literary works that includes various mythological
figures.[2]:41&ndash;42 The Rigveda of Hinduism is proposed to have
been composed between 1700&ndash;1100 BCE[3] making it possibly the
world's oldest religious text still in use. The oldest portions of
the Zoroastrian Avesta are believed to have been transmitted orally
for centuries before they found written form, and although widely
differing dates for Gathic Avestan (the language of the oldest texts)
have been proposed, scholarly consensus floats at around 1000
BCE.[citation needed]</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The majority
of scholars agree that the Torah's composition took place over
centuries.[4] From the late 19th century there was a general
consensus around the documentary hypothesis, which suggests that the
five books were created c.450 BCE by combining four originally
independent sources, known as the Jahwist, or J (about 900 BCE), the
Elohist, or E (about 800 BCE), the Deuteronomist, or D, (about 600
BCE), and the Priestly source, or P (about 500 BC).[5]</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The first
scripture printed for wide distribution to the masses was The Diamond
Sutra, a Buddhist scripture, and is the earliest recorded example of
a dated printed text, bearing the Chinese calendar date for 11 May
868 CE.[6]</P>

<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Attitudes to
sacred texts differ. Some religions make written texts widely and
freely available, while others hold that sacred secrets must remain
hidden from all but the loyal and the initiate. Most religions
promulgate policies defining the limits of the sacred texts and
controlling or forbidding changes and additions. Some religions view
their sacred texts as the &quot;Word of God&quot;, often contending
that the texts are inspired by God and as such not open to
alteration. Translations of texts may receive official blessing, but
an original sacred language often has de facto, absolute or exclusive
paramountcy. Some religions make texts available free or in
subsidized form; others require payment and the strict observance of
copyright.</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">References
to scriptures profit from standardisation: the Guru Granth Sahib (of
Sikhism) always appears with standardised page numbering while many
other religions (including the Abrahamic religions and their
offshoots) favour chapter and verse pointers.</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Other
terms[edit]</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Terms like
&quot;Holy Writ&quot;, &quot;Holy Scripture&quot; or &quot;Sacred
Scripture&quot; are often used by adherents to describe the canonical
works of their religion to denote the text's importance, its status
as divine revelation, or, as in the case of many Christian groups,
its complete inerrancy. Christianity is not alone in using this
terminology to revere its sacred book; Islam holds the Qur'an in
similar esteem, as does Hinduism the Vedas and Bhagavad Gita and
Buddhism the sutras.</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Hierographology[edit]</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Hierographology
(Ancient Greek: ?????, hieros, &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;holy&quot;,
+ ?????, graphe, &quot;writing&quot;, + ?????, logos, &quot;word&quot;
or &quot;reason&quot;) (archaically also 'hierology') is the study of
sacred texts.</P>
<P LANG="zxx" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Increasingly,
sacred texts of many cultures are studied within academic contexts,
primarily to increase understanding of other cultures, whether
ancient or contemporary. Sometimes this involves the extension of the
principles of higher criticism to the texts of many faiths. It may
also involve a comparative study of religious texts.</P>
