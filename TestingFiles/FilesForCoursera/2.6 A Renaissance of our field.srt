1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000


2
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,399
It was among other things the rediscovery of 
classical texts by

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Aristotle and Cicero that started a renewed 
interest in 

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,066
philosophy, art and the natural and social 
sciences.

5
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:27,632
Starting in 14th century Florence, the 
Renaissance quickly spread out

6
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,533
to the rest of Europe, paving the way for the 
Early Modern time. 

7
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:34,766
This was to a large degree thanks to the new 
printing possibilities

8
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:38,099
that Gutenbergâs invention made possible. 

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,833
Also, the role of Eastern scholars should not be 
overlooked.

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:47,333
In 265 the Roman Empire had been split in a 
Western and Eastern half. 

11
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:51,566
When the Western Roman Empire fell in the fifth 
century itâs traditions and sciences

12
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:56,099
lived on in the Eastern Roman Empire of 
Byzantium.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,633
In the Dark Ages of Western Europe, Byzantine 
scholars still kept extensive libraries

14
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:06,499
of classical literature and continued studying the 
science of rhetorica although it's importance 

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,266
had declined since advancement in the empire 
was much less dependent on 

16
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,966
public speaking and more on connections and 
status.

17
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:19,632
Why is this relevant for the Renaissance and 
subsequent Early Modern times? 

18
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:24,799
Well, in the fifthteenth century Byzantine power 
was crushed by the Ottoman Empire. 

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,766
The fall of itâs capital Constantinopel in 1453 led 
to a huge exodus of scholars

20
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,966
and artists from the Empire into Western 
Europe,

21
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:38,699
feeding the growing intellectual Renaissance 
with their work, thoughts and books. 

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,400
At the same time there was in many countries a 
shift of power.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,800
Religiously there was turmoil in Europe because 
of new ideas that led to The Reformation and

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,233
rise of several new religions. Most successful 
was of course the Protestant Church.

25
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:57,399
The Roman Catholic Church lost its religious 
monopoly

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,166
and now had to compete for the faith of the 
European people. 

27
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,266
Closely linked to this was a more worldly power 
struggle.

28
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:09,266
Democratic ideas from antiquity again gained 
wide interest. 

29
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:15,666
The introduction of effective weapons like the 
crossbow, the longbow and the first fire arms

30
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:20,899
gave the relatively untrained citizenry more 
military power to enforce their claims for more 

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,733
political power. That any peasant could now kill 
a knight with

32
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:29,866
a well-placed crossbow bolt was a lesson that 
wasnât learned quickly by the ruler elite. 

33
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:33,599
But after several successful uprisings and 
military coups,

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,200
the idea that it was practical to win the favour of 
the masses,

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,166
grudgingly became more accepted among the 
continents religious and worldly rulers.

36
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,699
Itâs not surprising then that next to scientific 
thought, arts and literature,

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,633
also the printing industry boomed as this graph 
clearly shows. 

38
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:54,299
Gutenbergs innovation can be dated in the 
1430âs

39
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,233
and at the end of the fifteenth century the 
printing industry had already spread out

40
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,533
through Europe and produced more than twenty 
million copies.

41
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:05,833
A century later this number increased to 200 
million. 

42
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,633
Another century later one billion books were 
produced.

43
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,699
Weâll take a closer look at this printing revolution 

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,066
and its importance for thought on 
communication in the next section of our 
MOOC.
