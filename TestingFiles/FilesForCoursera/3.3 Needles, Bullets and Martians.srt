1
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,266
The correlation between presumed cause and 
effect during the First World War

2
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:17,032
had massively increased the belief in the power 
of the media.

3
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:22,366
It was seen by many as an immensely powerful 
tool, either for good or ill.

4
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:26,266
Therefore, not only scientists, but governments 
too,

5
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:29,966
wanted to understand how persuasion through 
mass communication worked.

6
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:34,366
Scientists all over the world received funding to 
further study these phenomena,

7
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:38,199
which of course fuelled research in to this area. 

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,600
Persuasion through mass communication was a 
hot topic, 

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,666
both as a danger and as a potential solution for 
many problems. 

10
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,432
Economists were looking for ways to use the 
media

11
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:53,033
to turn the financial crisis of the twenties and 
thirties. 

12
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:58,133
Sociologists thought that the media could be 
used to strengthen or weaken role patterns, 

13
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:03,033
and they used these ideas to study the 
emancipation of women for instance.  

14
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:06,066
All of these scientists basically studied the 
question: 

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,999
how could one guard against the power of the 
media?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,633
and how could you harness its potential for your 
own benefit? 

17
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:19,266
The underlying notion is of course the premise 
that media have a huge effect on the behaviour 
of people.

18
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:24,066
Also commercially the all-powerful media 
paradigm thrived. 

19
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,466
The advertising industry boomed. 

20
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:32,132
And market research agencies started to study 
who read or listened to which medium. 

21
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:37,366
Media organizations needed this info to sell 
more ads for better prices. 

22
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,699
These commercial market researchers further 
added to existing knowledge

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,533
on the media landscape and its audiences. 

24
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:47,633
They also standardized techniques to conduct 
audience research,

25
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:53,599
for instance by large-scale surveys which were 
then statistically analyzed via a fixed format 

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,833
and repeated by others all over the world. 

27
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,233
The market research industry quickly grew

28
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:03,333
and maintained its own standards on high 
quality research. 

29
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,433
Many students who studied these issues in the 
university 

30
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,566
went on to work in one of the growing research 
firms,

31
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:13,299
using their theories and methods in a more 
practical setting, 

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,200
but with the same dominant attitude prevailing 

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,766
that media have a potential for great effects on 
the behaviour of their audiences. 

34
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,699
We call the theory that mass media have a 
direct,

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
immediate and powerful effect on its audiences

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,966
the hypodermic needle theory.  

37
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:34,366
Basically the sender âinjectsâ the message in to 
the audience with use of the media. 

38
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:40,732
The audience is seen as passive and more or 
less unable to resist and immediately affected.

39
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,133
It should be noted that effects, in this 
perspective, are seen as:

40
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,366
short term,

41
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,499
immediate,

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,466
focused on change rather than reinforcement, 

43
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,632
and finally

44
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:52,999
uniform among the audience, 

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,466
which means that audience factors are not really 
important. 

46
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:59,566
Another word for this theory is the âmagic bulletâ 
theory,

47
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,732
another cool name for basically the same 
metaphor:

48
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:09,699
a sender âfiresâ his message into the brain of a 
receiver with use of mediated communication. 

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,066
Scholars found many examples of the presumed 
power of mass communication 

50
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,732
and went forth to study these systematically. 

51
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:20,966
The most famous example is perhaps that of the 
Martian Invasion of 1938, 

52
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:25,766
when multitudes panicked because of a radio 
show in which Mars attacked the earth. 

53
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,699
Weâll discuss this example in the next section 
of our MOOC, 

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,366
first from the perspective of the all-powerful 
media, 

55
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,499
and then from a different angle.
