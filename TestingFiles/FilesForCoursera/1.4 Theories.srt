1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,866
Concepts play an important role in all theories. 

2
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,866
Theories in their simples definition are all 
statements about reality 

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,999
that seek to explain or predict the relation 
between phenomena. 

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,200


5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,266
For instance, the theory of gravity predicts that if I 
drop a pen, it will fall to the floor. 

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:29,599
A specific predicted result, derived from theory, 
we call a hypothesis.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,866
Whenever we visualise these statements this is 
called a model. 

8
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:38,266
Usually the arrows and lines in these models 
represent hypotheses.

9
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:43,599
The box on the left in this model represents the 
presumed cause, dropping the pencil. 

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,300
We call this the independent variable. The other 
is the presumed effect, or the dependent variable. 

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,266
If we change our example and look at the theory 
that giving someone a gift

12
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:57,366
causes them to like you better.

13
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:00,032
Than the independent variable here is giftgiving.

14
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:04,799
and the dependent variable is how much you are 
being liked by someone.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,366
So we can proof or disproof our hypotheses, and 
in extension the connected theory,

16
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:14,232
by actually dropping a pen or giving a gift

17
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:18,466
and check if the results correspond with the 
expected results.

18
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,666


19
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,699
In other words, we test and improve our theories 
with use of research.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,233
This can be primary research, where we collect 
our own data.

21
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:30,766
Or by studying the results of others, so called 
secondary research.

22
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,299


23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,700
We have several main means in our field to 
gather data.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,100
The first is observation, simply observing the 
phenomenon.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,033
Secondly we conduct experiments, where we try 
to limit to amount of interfering variables

26
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:51,099
so we can actually proof a causal relation 
between the dependent and independent variable. 

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,966


28
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:58,566
We also use surveys, which is a questionnaire 
spread amongst a sample of respondents.

29
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,799
The results are usually quantified.

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,000
For a more in depth exploration of attitudes we 
conduct qualitative interviews.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,900
Finally we study the message itself. This is called 
content analysis.

32
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:15,066
It can be done systematically, where the results 
are later quantified. 

33
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,332
Or it can be done in a qualitative fashion.

34
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,766


35
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:23,499
Of course this is the ideal scientific situation. In 
reality many theories canât be tested.

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,366
For instance because we can not observe the 
presumed relation. 

37
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:31,199
The theory that âeverything happens for a reasonâ 
might be true, 

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,500
but we donât really have access to the methods to 
test this.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Sometimes a theory will combine a set of 
theories.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,233
For instance The Uses and Gratification Theory: 

41
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:43,466
which is a complex theory that we will discuss 
later in depth in this class. 

42
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:47,766
The point for now is that it contains several ideas 
about reality.

43
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:51,566
First of all, people make conscious decisions 
regarding their use of media.

44
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:55,332
Secondly, people are conscious of their media-
related needs. 

45
00:02:55,333 --> 00:03:00,666
Thirdly, people select the media that is best 
suited to fulfill their needs. 

46
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,732
These are only a few elements of this theory, but 
my point is

47
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:08,266
that even though these different statements can 
be tested and proven independently,

48
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:11,699
they are still part of the same theoretical 
framework and therefore

49
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,200
collectively labeled as Uses and Gratification 
Theory.

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,300
So the definition of theory is not as easy as we 
first thought.

51
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:21,732


52
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,866
Some theories donât even predict anything but 
serve more as perspectives on reality

53
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,999
or to sum up an approach.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,833
They tell us it is important to study some aspects 
of that reality more thoroughly.

55
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,366


56
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:37,566
For instance âstakeholder theoryâ tells us we 
should study the stakeholders in any situation

57
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,932
and be aware of their various interests and 
agendas.

58
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,533
These perspectives are sometimes called 
theory,

59
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,833
but we also use the words paradigms or 
approaches,

60
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,266
since they donât really fit the dominant definition of 
scientific theory.

61
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,700


62
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,333
That definition stresses that theories have 
predictive value. 

63
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,466
And these paradigms or approaches serve more 
as view glasses, 

64
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,132
which we use to study the world.

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,366
They amplify some aspects of reality and guide 
our research.
