1
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:12,532
I just explained that the belief in the all-powerful 
media

2
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:17,233
had fuelled academic research in to the topic of 
mass communication. 

3
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:22,433
Although many anecdotes, like the Martian 
Attack, seemed to indicate great effects, 

4
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:28,033
further scientific exploration actually failed to 
prove this hypothesis. 

5
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:33,599
Many researchers now argued that the effects of 
mass communications had been overestimated. 

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,733
Also the idea of a passive audience that is either 
shot or injected was also rejected.

7
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:40,899
Also the idea of a passive audience that is either 
shot or injected was also rejected.

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,133
World War I and later World War II propaganda 
was again looked at in this light 

9
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,833
and scholars, like the influential psychologist 
Carl Hovland,

10
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,166
found that audience members were often not 
passive at all 

11
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:58,166
but quite able to select messages and block 
persuasive attempts. 

12
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:03,799
Especially when they were aware a forehand 
that there was going to be a persuasion attempt

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,033
this is the so called inoculation theory,

14
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,566
the core premise of which is basically

15
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:12,666
that a prepared audience is better able to resist 
persuasion.

16
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:17,232
Also they found that it was often difficult to prove 
the power of media in reality                                          

17
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:19,666
because there are too many variables in real life 

18
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:25,599
to reliably ascertain the effect of one specific 
variable like media influence. 

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,366
When Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet studied 
the effects

20
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:31,666
of the Roosevelt presidential campaign of 1940, 

21
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,499
they found that people were not swayed by the 
campaign efforts.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,733
There was some influence 

23
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:40,433
but this had more to do with reinforcement of a 
position someone already had

24
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,733
than with actual change.

25
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:47,799
Another element of the magic bullet theory was 
debunked by this. 

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Also the researchers found that people were in 
fact influenced quite a lot, 

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,966
not by the media but by so called opinion 
leaders. 

28
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:00,932
Opinion leaders are those who influence and 
inform the people around them. 

29
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,999
Typically opinion leaders expose themselves to 
media

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,500
in order to be informed and reinforce their 
standpoints with arguments. 

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,000
in order to be informed and reinforce their 
standpoints with arguments. 

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,766
A so called two-step flow model was proposed 
were people are influenced by opinion leaders. 

33
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,766
The media use of these opinion leaders was of 
course very different

34
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:20,966
than the old powerful media model would 
suggest.

35
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:24,432
They actively sought out media they wanted to 
use,

36
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:29,033
made selections based on their own opinions, 
wants and needs.

37
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:34,233
So basically they are quite powerful and not 
easily manipulated at all. 

38
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,299
The powerful media paradigm was discarded 

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,300
and scholars like Lazarsfeld proposed a 
âminimal effectsâ theory instead.

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,733
Media are only one of many variables in a 
situation, 

41
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,366
and often not the most influential one by far. 

42
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:51,566
People are more likely to be persuaded through 
social means 

43
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:56,166
and therefore media use and influence should be 
studied from this perspective.

44
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,666
Not viewing the audience as uniform and passive 

45
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,066
but in fact taking into consideration audience 
factors, 

46
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:07,366
seeing that effects can differ from person to 
person and group to group. 

47
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:12,399
This approach can be characterized by a 
famous quote from Berelson

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,666
"Some kinds of communication, on some kinds 
of issues,

49
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,032
brought to the attention of some kinds of people, 

50
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:23,199
under some kinds of conditions, have some 
kinds of effects." 

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,266
Although the minimal effects paradigm was 
becoming more popular, 

52
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:32,899
two things happened that sparked a new popular 
belief in the powerful media idea. 

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,933
Firstly we gradually learned more and more 
about the Holocaust

54
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:40,599
and the world needed theories that explained 
how this horror could have happened

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,766
and why so many had kept silent during the 
reign of Hitler. 

56
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,766
Secondly a new mass medium quickly rose to 
prominence, 

57
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:52,832
drastically changing the media landscape and 
peopleâs daily lives. 

58
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,099
Television.
