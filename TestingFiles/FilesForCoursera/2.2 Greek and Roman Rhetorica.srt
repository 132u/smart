1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:12,199
So letâs start by briefly exploring the Classical 
World of the Greek and Romans.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,300
Weâll begin in the fifth century before Christ, 
Ancient Greece. 

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,400
Instead of one country we should first recognize 
that in these times 

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,866
Greece was a collection of independent city-
states,

5
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:24,199
some were at war with each other, and others 
were allied. 

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,533
A growing number of city states was adopting 
democratic elements in their governments

7
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:32,433
such as peopleâs assemblies, elections, chosen 
government officials and such. 

8
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,766
Even though many cities still had kings or a 
council of nobles,

9
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,999
the political power of citizens was growing,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,833
and with it the need for a better understanding of 
the workings of mass communication.

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:48,433
Itâs therefore not surprising that the science of 
communication thrived in Ancient Greece. 

12
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,599
Important historical figures like Socrates, Plato 
and Aristotles

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
were involved in academic debate on the 
subject.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,066
But besides being an academic science it was 
in this time foremost an applied science. 

15
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,932
There were teachers and academies that taught 
the main principles of public speaking, 

16
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,766
reasoning and persuasion. 

17
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,966
Ambitious politicians were wise to learn the 
different ways of approaching an audience. 

18
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:15,466
And not only politicians, but also lawyers and 
businessmen were schooled in these matters 

19
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,299
and made extensive use of it in their field. 

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,233
Military commanders like Xenophon and 
Alexander the Great 

21
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,499
had also studied the subject at the feet of 
famous philosophers

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,533
and used what they learned to keep up moral of 
their troops.

23
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:31,866
So what did the media landscape look like at 
this time?

24
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,599
Well, first of all, we already established that 
public speaking was important.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,800
Secondly, Greeks made extensive use of 
symbolic en figurative communication,

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,600
through their art, useable artifacts and 
architecture. 

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,400
Also there was a huge diversity of genres in 
theater,

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,533
and finally there were many written media,

29
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:55,099
the alphabet had been rediscovered in the sixth 
century and books, scrolls, pamphlets

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,066
quickly found a place in the media infrastructure. 

31
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,366
Many people, not only the rich and noble, could 
read and write

32
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:04,199
and most cities had one or several libraries. 

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,366
The most famous library, that of Alexandria, 

34
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:10,266
reputedly contained hundreds of thousands of 
handwritten scrolls. 

35
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:15,532
After several centuries the power of the Greeks 
dwindled and was broken by the Romans 

36
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:18,133
who themselves adopted many Greek ways. 

37
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:21,133
Itâs therefore not surprising that they too learned 

38
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:24,266
and tried to perfect on Greek theories on 
communication. 

39
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:28,266
Together Greek and Roman times span over a 
millennium of history

40
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,199
and even more if we include the Byzantine 
Empire in this

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
So itâs obviously a huge oversimplification to 
discuss all classical thought

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,866
on communication in a three minute MOOC 
section. 

43
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,532
But weâll try nonetheless,

44
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:44,233
because their ideas were the basis for scientific 
thought on communication 

45
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,633
during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

46
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:51,166
and therefore in many ways the foundation on 
which our modern discipline is built. 

47
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,299
For a more in-depth and nuanced picture 

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,800
I refer to the Little Box of Nuance in the online 
environment of this course 

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,533
and the follow-up opportunities I give in other 
sections, like the platform,

50
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:06,133
and the online community, on Facebook and 
LinkedIn
