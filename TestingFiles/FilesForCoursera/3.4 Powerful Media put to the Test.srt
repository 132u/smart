[War of the Worlds]

2
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:19,799
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program 
of dance music, to bring you a special bulletin

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,900
from the intercontinental radio news

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,133
At twenty minutes before eight, central time, 

5
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:27,566
Professor Farrell of the Mount Jennings 
Observatory, Chicago, Illinois, 

6
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:30,999
reports observing several explosions of 
incandescent gas,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,866
occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars. 

8
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,599
The spectroscope indicates the gas to be 
hydrogen 

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,333
and moving towards the earth with enormous 
velocity. 

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,633
Professor Pierson of the Observatory at 
Princeton confirms Farrell's observation,

11
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:50,766
and describes the phenomenon as (quote) like a 
jet of blue flame shot from a gun (unquote). 

12
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:50,799
and describes the phenomenon as (quote) like a 
jet of blue flame shot from a gun (unquote). 

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,133
In New York, October 1938, CBS aired a radio 
drama about a Martian Invasion.

14
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:02,833
Director Orson Welles had adapted H.G. Wells 
famous book War of the Worlds for the radio. 

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:07,366
Most of the show consists of news reports on 
the ongoing Martian attack. 

16
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:11,732
It starts slowly with an interview with a leading 
astronomer.

17
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,666
Nothing seems very wrong yet, as the interview 
is followed by a weather report 

18
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,432
and a performance of an orchestra for the 
listeners home. 

19
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,199
But while the story progresses the reports 
become more frantic

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,433
and describe several losing battles of the human 
army against the Martians.

21
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:31,433
The captain is conferring with someone. We 
can't quite see who. 

22
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,033
Oh yes, I believe it's Professor Pierson. Yes, it 
is. 

23
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:38,233
Now they've parted. The Professor moves around 
one side, studying the object, 

24
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,866
while the captain and two policemen advance 
with something in their hands.

25
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:45,266
I can see it now. It's a white handkerchief tied to 
a pole . . .

26
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,732
a flag of truce.

27
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:51,466
If those creatures know what that means . . . 
what anything means!. . . 

28
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,466
Wait a minute! Something's happening! 

29
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,632
(HISSING SOUND) 

30
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:56,666
A humped shape is rising out of the pit.

31
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:01,232
I can make out a small beam of light against a 
mirror. 

32
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,533
What's that?

33
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,666
There's a jet of flame springing from the mirror, 
and it leaps right at the advancing men.

34
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,299
It strikes them head on! 

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,666
Good Lord, they're turning into flame! 

36
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,566
(SCREAMS AND UNEARTHLY SHRIEKS) 

37
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:15,766
Now the whole field's caught fire. The woods . . . 
the barns . . . the gas tanks of automobiles . . .

38
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:18,666
it's spreading everywhere. It's coming this way. 
About twenty yards to my right . . . 

39
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:24,432


40
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:27,099
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances 
beyond our control, 

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,366
we are unable to continue the broadcast from 
Grover's Mill.

42
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,999
Evidently there's some difficulty ... 

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,900
This example is often used to illustrate the 
power of mediated communication

44
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,600
since the broadcast reputedly led to mass 
panic.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400


46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,733
Newspapers report that thousands ran scared in 
to streets, 

47
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,333
and we get the idea that complete 
pandemonium ensued.

48
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,666
This would of course indicate exactly what the 
magic bullet theory predicts:

49
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:58,266
immediate, short-term, uniform effects among 
the masses. 

50
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:58,732
immediate, short term, uniform effects among 
the masses. 

51
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:05,233
However, scientists that studied this incident, 
most notably Paul Lazarsfeld and Herta Herzog, 

52
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:09,833
actually found evidence that suggested a more 
nuanced picture. 

53
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,299
First of all, many people had tuned in long after 
the show started, 

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,633
thereby missing the introduction that explained 
it was a show. 

55
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:22,466
More importantly, they found that contextual 
factors had influenced the collective reaction.

56
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:26,632
It was 1938 and the news media had informed 
their audiences

57
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:30,099
on the potential of an upcoming war with 
Germany. 

58
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,100
So people were forewarned that a war might 
happen.

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,266
Research showed that some who panicked 
actually missed the part about the Martians

60
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,332
and assumed it was a German invasion that 
took place.

61
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,899
Another important finding was that newspapers 
had probably

62
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,233
exaggerated somewhat the 'widespread panic', 
that followed the broadcast. 

63
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:50,266


64
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:54,132
Reality was perhaps less sensational:

65
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,933
yes hundreds of thousands were frightened to 
some degree, 

66
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:01,233
but in reality most of them had not acted on 
their fear,

67
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,299
no evidence of hysterical screaming masses in 
the streets,

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,733
no suicides by people who wanted to stay out of 
the hands of the Martians.

69
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:12,733
Later Lazarsfeld again criticized the magic bullet 
theory,

70
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,899
this time together with Berelson and Gaudet 

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,233
when they disproved the hypothesis that voters 
were persuaded to vote for Roosevelt

72
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,533
 because of his extensive campaign. 

73
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,266
These studies are examples of a line of 
questioning

74
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,799
in to the all-powerful media paradigm by 
scholars. 

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,200
They were systematically testing the magic 
bullet hypothesis 

76
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,300
and had been unable to reproduce the presumed 
effects in an experimental setting. 

77
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,766
Also scientists found that often in cases of 
presumed huge effects in real-life scenarios,

78
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:44,599
like the Martian Scare of 1938, 

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,666
there were many other variables to take into 
consideration, besides media influence. 

80
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:54,132
Because these critical notions were the result of 
a long list of scientific studies. 

81
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,599
we call this paradigm,

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,500
the powerful media put to the test.
