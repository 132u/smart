1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,700
After several years of rising political tensions, 
World War I erupted in the year 1914. 

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,066
I have to be careful not to make this in to a 
history class, 

3
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:21,699
but itâs important for us to realize the impact of 
this war on our topic. 

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,433
First of all that the war was brewing was quite 
apparent for all in the Western World. 

5
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:31,099
Newspapers and magazines gave a lot of 
attention to the political and military

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,633
 manoeuvring on the European continent.

7
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:40,066
In short, some in the media landscape were 
actually campaigning for an aggressive stance 

8
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,532
and seemed to be looking forward to a coming 
conflict.

9
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:48,499
Perhaps under the misconception that it would 
be a short and relatively clean skirmish

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,033
that would restore the preferred balance of 
power.

11
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:55,599
In reality, populations all over the world were

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,066
bombarded with patriotic messages and a call to 
arms. 

13
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:03,532
Of course this wasnât the only content in the 
media landscape,

14
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,799
but several years later, scientists that studied 
what had happened,

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,666
noticed the two correlating variables:

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,266
media that were campaigning for war and 
patriotism

17
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:22,332
and a motivated, patriotic population, set for war 
and many men volunteering to be a soldier

18
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,499
in one of the bloodiest wars the continent had 
ever seen. 

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,133
When the war started, all sides made use of 
massive propaganda campaigns. 

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:36,333
That's another important concept from our field, 
propaganda.

21
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:42,833
Itâs often referred to as âone-sidedâ, âbiasedâ and 
âunobjectiveâ communication. 

22
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,699
Jowett and OâDonnel define propaganda as 

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,766
âthe deliberate, systematic attempt to shape 
perceptions, manipulate cognitions, 

24
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:57,332
and direct behaviour to achieve a response that 
furthers the desired intent of the propagandistâ. 

25
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,433
The world had in 1914 never seen such a huge 
âpushâ

26
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:06,066
to influence so many at the same time with use 
of mediated communication.

27
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,732
The political and military leaders had perhaps 
learned

28
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,199
their lessons from the ancient Greeks and 
Romans. 

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,533
They too wielded the sword of communication

30
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,266
as if it was just one other weapon in their 
arsenal, 

31
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:20,232
piercing the mind with its persuasive message.

32
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:24,033
Again, scholars who studied events directly after 
the First World War

33
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:28,733
noticed a correlation between an intensive 
propaganda attempt and

34
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:33,166
all kinds of effects that were assumed to be the 
effect of this propaganda. 

35
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,166
It was seen as a reason why soldiers marched 
cheerfully in to war. 

36
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:42,032
Why the home front showed such a uniform 
support and respect for their military. 

37
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:45,066
Why enemy soldiers decided to defect in mass, 

38
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:49,266
to be imprisoned in military camps for the 
remainder of the war. 

39
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:54,166
The importance of World War I on 
communication theory is, to put it simple:

40
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:58,932
it created a huge belief in the power of mass 
communication through the media. 

41
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:02,133
We call this the all-powerful media paradigm.
