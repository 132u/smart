00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:19,399
We can make a broad distinction between two 
schools of classical thought on communication. 

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,833
The first school sees communication as a way 
to discover the truth of things. 

3
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,933
This school started with the famous philosopher 
Socrates and his student Plato. 

4
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,599
They put a huge emphasis on the role of 
discourse

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,766
and logical argumentation in the communication 
process. 

6
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,232
It is called the dialectic method:

7
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,966
which is simply put that logical and rational 
discussion

8
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:45,799
will help us resolve differences by finding out 
which viewpoint is true. 

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:53,733
Therefore mans ability to reason is paramount 
for a civilization to flourish and advance. 

10
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:53,766


11
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:53,799


12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,166
Here we have, in a nutshell, the purpose of 
communication,

13
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,099
to express and critically weigh the value of 
ideas, 

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,600
and eventually to discard or perfect them in 
correlation with their objective worth. 

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,533
As models go, this one is obviously quite linear. 

16
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:14,966
Good communication is rational communication 
that helps us to find âthe truthâ in ideas.

17
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:19,866
It' easy to see why so many philosophers, who 
were also interested in natural science

18
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:24,132
and finding out how the world worked, were 
attracted to this school of thought.

19
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,366
Later, Medieval monks were also charmed

20
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,532
by this classical idea of communication to reach 
the truth.

21
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:33,466
It was in their opinion a way for pre-Christian 
Greeks and Romans

22
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,866
to see the greater truth of God.

23
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:38,132
So even though they were not Christians,

24
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,633
the writings of Plato and such were copied by 
Christian monks and have survived

25
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,866
while so many books of their contemporaries 
havenât.

26
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:50,799
Usually we only know about these other books  
because Plato and such refer and react to them.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,600
This second school of Greek communication 
science was called rhetorica. 

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,700
Derived from the Greek á¿¥Î®ÏÏÏ (rhá¸tÅr) which 
means "public speaker".

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,166
Rhetorica taught the ability to perceive all 
means of persuasion in any given scenario, 

30
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,932
according to Aristotle in one of his books on the 
topic. 

31
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:05,699


32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,100


33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,533
So it was very much an applied science, where 
the practicality of theories decided their worth. 

34
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:15,533
The main purpose was not to find truth but to 
persuade someone, 

35
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,466
so essentially to make something seem like the 
truth even if it wasnât.

36
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:22,466
Proponents of this school were also called 
sophists, 

37
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:26,366
and were often attacked vehemently by natural 
philosophers like Socrates and Plato, 

38
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,699
who above all else searched for the truth.

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,466
Later, many sophist writing was purposely not 
copied by Medieval monks for this same reason. 

40
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:37,632
Despite the disapproval among natural 
philosophers,

41
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,699
rhetorica was extremely popular in the Classical 
world. 

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,033
Not only in Greece but in Rome too 

43
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:48,533
the ability to win people over through speeches 
was crucial for political or social advancement. 

44
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:53,633
Caesar, Marc Anthony, Octavian, they were all 
trained in 

45
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,966
and sometimes wrote about the art of 
persuasion. 

46
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:01,032
Usually they had studied the basics of rhetorica 
in Greece itself. 

47
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,399
Luckily some books on rhetorica did survive. 

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,300
Most notably those by the Greek philosopher 
Aristotle 

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,400
and the Roman statesman Marcus Cicero. 

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,533
So what exactly did they teach? 

51
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:17,199
Weâll talk about some basic rhetorical theory in 
the next section.
