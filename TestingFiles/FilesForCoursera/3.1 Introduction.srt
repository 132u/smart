00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,832
Welcome in week 3 of our MOOC Introduction to 
Communication Science. 

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,666
Hopefully you have learned something about the 
history of communication science and

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,766
of course it was a history in a nutshell, 

4
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:22,099
so it would be great if you checked out the 
further readings section

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,266
we call it a 'Little box of nuance'.

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:28,432
And there is a lively debate developing on 
Facebook and on our forum. 

7
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,866
As you might remember from our first class,

8
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:35,332
I have divided the main theories in our field in 
three broad approaches,

9
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,233
The first approach is of course the linear effect-
oriented approach

10
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:43,766
this was for a long time, and perhaps to some 
extent still is,

11
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:46,566
 the dominant approach in our field. 

12
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,832
It is a perspective that is largely concerned with 
the presumed effects

13
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,133
of mass and mediated communication,

14
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,366
or in other words, the power of the media. 

15
00:00:55,366 --> 00:01:02,032
Iâll talk about this type of theories and how they 
developed in the twentieth century this week. 

16
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:05,733
The second approach was the processing and 
signification approach, 

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,833
which will be the topic for next week. 

18
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,833
After that, weâll discuss the third approach 

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:15,866
that focuses on how we use communication to 
construct our social and cultural reality.

20
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:16,099
that focuses on how we use communication to 
construct our social and cultural reality.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,433
But for now, weâll focus on linear effect-oriented 
theories

22
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,933
and the developing ideas on the power of the 
media. 

23
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,333
We left off last week at the end of the nineteenth 
century,

24
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:30,499
start of the twentieth century when scholarly 
thought had now accepted the idea 

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,066
that the media were a political, economical and 
social force to be reckoned with. 

26
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,332
The eighteenth and nineteenth century had been 

27
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,533
riddled with practical examples of their 
persuasive powers.

28
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,966
People were surrounded by a rich media 
landscape. 

29
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:50,932
Different channels, most noticeably print media 
like pamphlets, newspapers and magazines 

30
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,433
clamored for attention. 

31
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,566
New audience groups had been discovered and 
quickly targeted. 

32
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:00,832
The political parties that were born in the 
nineteenth century

33
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,733
already had faithful followers at the turn of the 
century. 

34
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,999
Their party media could count on a returning 
audience. 

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,266
This political press served as a signpost, 

36
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:17,699
telling their voters the viewpoints of the party and 
engaging other parties in lively media debates. 

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,133
Freedom of the press was seen by politicians as 
necessary for the media 

38
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:25,266
to fulfill its purpose as a fourth estate, 

39
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:28,699
a political institute and check on government 
power,

40
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,966
and therefore press freedom was adopted in 
many constitutions all over the world.

41
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:39,199
Itâs not surprising that economists, political 
scientists and sociologists 

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,933
respected the power of and sometimes voiced 
an opinion on mass communication.

43
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:51,433
But it was not yet a full-fledged scientific 
perspective. And this would soon change.
