1
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:15,733
While scientists all over were adhering to the 
minimal effects hypothesis, 

2
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:22,099
a different contrary trend led to a so-called 
rediscovery of the powerful media paradigm. 

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,166
One important reason for this

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:28,966
were the many presumed effects of 
communication during the Second World War.

5
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:32,699
Not only historians but sociologists too pointed

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,166
at the concerted propaganda efforts of both the 
Allied and Axis forces. 

7
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,732
Specifically the situation in Nazi Germany that 
had caused so many to agree with 

8
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:47,499
and later not object to Hitlerâs policies was an 
important theme for study. 

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
This new paradigm that formed, 

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,366
the Powerful Media Rediscovered 

11
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:54,999
was slightly more nuanced then the older 
Powerful Media paradigm.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,400
was slightly more nuanced then the older 
Powerful Media paradigm.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,366
Scientists had learned from the studies of 
Lazarsfeld and Hovland and such

14
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:03,799
that direct, immediate and uniform effects were 
difficult to prove.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,966
But ever since World War II there was a growing 
body of scientific work forming

16
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:15,399
that suggested strong long-term, indirect and 
personal effects. 

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,033
New theories on powerful media were more 
nuanced than the older ones, 

18
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:24,199
and saw the effects more in terms of 
reinforcement than actual change.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,933
Not only scientists objected to the minimal 
effect theory: 

20
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:34,066
popular belief in the Powerful Media Paradigm 
remained strong, and only grew after the war. 

21
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:39,266
Many people working in the advertisement, 
political campaigning or in the media industry

22
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,699
could not come to terms with the minimal 
effects thesis

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,600
and added anecdotal evidence that further 
supported the idea of a powerful media. 

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,700
World War II propaganda had in the popular eye 
been extremely influential

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,233
even though scientists were still arguing this 

26
00:01:55,233 --> 00:02:00,699
because it had helped create a huge social 
support for the war effort. 

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,000
The idea that the media had failed pre-war 
Germany was also apparent. 

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,833
Why hadnât the Fourth Estate stopped the rise 
of Hitler? 

29
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,899
What was the use of a check on government 
power

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,600
if it didnât stop something like this from 
happening. 

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,000
These and other instances were media owners 
misused their powers 

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,900
led to a Commission on Freedom of the Press 
to investigate the democratic role of the media. 

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,266
In 1947 they published their report, and it's still 
the basis for our modern thought today on this.

34
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:35,966
They concluded that yes, like the Fourth Estate 
model,

35
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,132
the press is crucial for a healthy political 
system, 

36
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,899
because they serve as a platform for opinions of 
the people 

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,933
and they serve as a check on government 
power. 

38
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,266
However, unlike the Fourth Estate model,

39
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,032
which included that the media should be free of 
any constrictions,

40
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,666
the Commission proposed:

41
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,799
a) that in order for the media to serve the people, 

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,600
there should be guidelines that govern media 
behaviour.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,800
and b) that the basis of these guidelines should 
be a feeling of social responsibility.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,666
This is why this model is called the social 
responsibility model. 

45
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:19,099
and c) The Commission stated that every 
political institute needs checks and balances,

46
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,800
therefore also the media canât be completely 
without restrictions. 

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,033
There is room for government interference in 
extreme cases.

48
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:30,733
d) however, it is preferable to avoid extreme 
measures,

49
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,666
therefore the media should govern themselves

50
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,266
through a system of a professional codes of 
ethics, 

51
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:38,966
upheld by a self-imposed regulatory body.

52
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:43,299
It is this Social Responsibility Model that is in 
fact dominant today.

53
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,133
Each country has of course its own variation, 

54
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:50,499
but usually there is some rules that media 
organizations adhere to. 

55
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,000
And there is some sort of committee made up of 
media professionals

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,300
that donât hold any official power but media 
organizations agree

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,033
that this court can fine them

58
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:05,999
and give other sanctions when the professional 
code is breached. 

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,500
The introduction all over the world of this new 
system of media governance clearly shows that

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,100
despite the fact that scientifically the issue was 
under debate 

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,000
the powerful media idea was still widespread. 

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,700
This belief further increased with the rise of 
television.
