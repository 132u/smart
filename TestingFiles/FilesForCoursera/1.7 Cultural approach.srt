1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,233
We have just discussed an alternative to the 
linear effect oriented approach. 

2
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:15,066
One that looks at message construction and 
interpretation,  

3
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:18,466
and leaves room for multiple meanings of a 
message.  

4
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:22,266
The third perspective I want to discuss is a 
continuation of this line of thought  

5
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:26,232
but shifts the focus to cultural and social 
aspects of communication. 

6
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:29,566
This approach deals with how we use 
communication to give

7
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:33,132
meaning to the world around us, construct our 
own social reality,

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:33,166


9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,499
the role of communication in group dynamics 
and social interaction.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,400
This perspective makes use of insights from the 
field of sociology, social psychology and 
anthropology,

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,566
where much attention is given to the social 
context in which communication takes place.

12
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:51,166
It sees communication as the means to share 
and reinforce ideas,

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,299
thereby constantly creating and adapting our 
culture. 

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,800
Also it sees people as social animals,

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,633
as such we are constantly involved in social 
group dynamics.

16
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,933
To illustrate this approach, letâs examine this 
communication model,

17
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,466
proposed by Newcomb as early as 1953. 

18
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,799
The model starts out with two familiar elements: 
sender and receiver.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,966
Letâs call them person A and person B. 

20
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:16,966
Newcomb thought that the main purpose of 
communication is to maintain some sort of

21
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:20,699
balance, a harmony or equilibrium in a social 
system.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:20,733


23
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,233
He therefore introduced a new element,

24
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:25,899
the social environment that person A and person 
B share. 

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Weâll call this shared social environment X for 
now. 

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,666
These three elements A, B and X, are all 
connected to each other in one social system,

27
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:41,232
if one element changes, this changes the 
relationship of the three. 

28
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,299
I will give an example.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,433
Letâs say person A is David and person B is 
Shirley. 

30
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,766
Shirley and David are colleagues in the same 
department,

31
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,066
so this is their shared social environment.

32
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,932
If David quits his job to work somewhere else 

33
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:58,266
this means that they no longer have that same 
shared social environment,

34
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,032
their workplace and shared office lunches. 

35
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:04,733
This will inevitably change the relationship 
between Dave and Shirley. 

36
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,666
Perhaps theyâll decide they enjoyed their lunch 
breaks so much

37
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,132
they will now have coffee each month,

38
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,299
even though they donât work together any more, 

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,100
thereby going from collegues to friends.

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,500
In another scenario David changes jobs within 
the company and now becomes Shirleyâs boss. 

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,700
This will also influence their relationship 
somehow. 

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,933
Will they still continue to have friendly lunches 
each day? 

43
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,866
X can take many forms,

44
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:33,399
the place you work, political allegiance, a group 
you belong to, it can even be a person.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,333
Letâs say X is another co-worker named Ellen. 

46
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,966
David and Shirley both like Ellen,

47
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:42,299
 until Ellen and Shirley get into a fight. 

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,633
Now Davids relationship with the both of them 
will change, 

49
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:49,133
he might choose sides or set himself up as a 
neutral party.

50
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:54,466
Regardless of his choice, a new social balance 
will be found, and equilibrium restored.

51
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,066
This according to Newcomb is the main function 
of communication. 

52
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:02,399
Later other scientists have continued with this 
idea, making other theories that

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,066
specifically looked at mediated, individual, mass 
or group communication.

54
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,966
 In later weeks weâll go more in depth on this. 

55
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:12,966
To go back to the core of Newcomb's model, 
and also the core of this third approach: 

56
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:15,532
Communication helps us get along with each 
other,

57
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,666
make sense of the social world around us 

58
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,266
and enables us to function as social animals. 

59
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:24,132
Therefore, itâs crucial for a stable and healthy 
society. 

60
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:28,099
Because without communication, we don't really 
feel part of society. 

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,000
We canât position ourselves in social reality, for 
instance by aligning ourselves with in-groups

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,800
or opposing ourselves against out-groups. 

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,233
Central to this approach is the notion that 
people construct a cultural and social reality

64
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:44,899
by constantly communicating values, attitudes 
and ideas. 

65
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,733
This idea is sometimes called social 
constructionism.
