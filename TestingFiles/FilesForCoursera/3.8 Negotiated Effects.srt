00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,266
The final paradigm I want to discuss with you 
this week 

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:15,566
is a compromise between the minimal effects 
and powerful media perspectives. 

3
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:19,666
Combining elements of both models the 
negotiated media effects model states that 

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,366
media and communication in general,

5
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:27,832
not only mass, the focus is broader than that, 
have a potential for great power.

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:33,566
Effects can be short term, direct, immediate, 
after one-shot exposure et cetera.

7
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:40,432
However, more often, strong and enduring effects 
are based on long term, repeated exposure 

8
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:44,999
 where the content reinforces rather than 
changes the audiences beliefs. 

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,666
This perspective combines the insights of 
political en economical scholars with those of 

10
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:54,066
psychologists, sociologists and even cultural 
anthropologists,

11
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,499
looks at human development and sees 
persuasion as something continuous. 

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,300
Something that is not to be avoided, because 
we need it to function.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,233
It canât be avoided without losing that which 
connects us with each other. 

14
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,566
Many studies with children were now done,

15
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:14,732
to find out more about the role of communication 
during crucial development phases. 

16
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:18,499
Also, many societal problems, like crime, 
prejudice, aggressive

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,300
and anti-social behaviour were now linked to 
communication,

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,066
either as a cause or a possible solution. And 
often, both.

19
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:33,699
Tries to merge qualitative and quantitative 
methods. 

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,133
For instance by backing qualitative statements

21
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:41,933
with quantitative data, thereby aiming to 
measure the subjective. 

22
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:47,766
Looks at all kinds of effects.

23
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,632
Agenda Setting for instance is a theory that 
proposes

24
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:55,433
that the media donât tell us what to think, but 
what to think about.

25
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:59,466
The media agenda therefore influences the 
public agenda,

26
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:03,666
if the marriage of some celebrity is much 
discussed in the news

27
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,966
it will probably feature higher on the public 
perception as well.

28
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:10,666
The media tell us which items are important, 

29
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,632
where important things happen and why.

30
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:18,233
The amount of attention given to environmental 
pollution by the media for instance

31
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,699
can cause a higher percentage of people 
thinking about this subject 

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,900
and a higher percentage of people evaluating 
environmental pollution

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
as a serious and important problem.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,733
Frames define problems, shape possible 
solutions and basically help a person 

35
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:36,099
deconstruct a message in a particular way.

36
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,400
For instance, when we are talking about 
pollution of the environment,

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,600
we can have many different angles to approach 
this topic.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,700
We can talk about the big pollutors in the world, 
or what you as a consumer can do,

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,500
or we can go down into the basic facts and 
figures of global warming.

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,233
These are all different frames that will lead to a 
different deconstruction of the message.

41
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,299
In these photoâs the same news event,

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,300
the tearing down of Saddam Hussein's Statue, 
is depicted. 

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
The frame is however quite different,

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,800
thereby probably changing how we deconstruct 
the message.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
We can see that these types of theories no 
longer focus on the intention of the sender 

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,566
but rather on message construction and 
deconstruction.

47
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,232
So no longer the linear effect oriented approach

48
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:28,599
but a focus on the construction and the 
reception of a message.

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,166
On processing and signification. We are going 
to continue with that topic, next week.

50
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,799
I hope to see you then!
