1
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,432
In the Middles Ages the importance of public 
speaking grew less.

2
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:17,399
The political system was completely different of 
course so citizens were 

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,066
basically left out of the political decision making 
process.

4
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:24,999
They couldnât vote and held little political power, 
beyond the power to rebel. 

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,500
But seeing that the ruler elite were practiced 
warriors who wielded deadly weaponry

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,400
and impressive armour, both extremely 
expensive, 

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,800
even this was usually not much of a choice. 

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,033
Although rhetorica was taught in Medieval 
universities to a small elite,

9
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:46,166
it had by no means the importance of classical 
times. 

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,966
Not only was there little to no communication 
science in the Dark Ages,

11
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,799
the communication landscape had also changed 
drastically

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,266
since Roman times. Alfabecy numbers had 
dropped rapidly since the decline of Rome. 

13
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:02,066
Almost none could write or read with perhaps 
some exceptions

14
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,599
among the ruler and religious elite. 

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,000
But even among them evidence suggests 
readership was not high

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and probably very limited to those of very high 
stations

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,466
or devoted to academic life in a monastery. It 
makes sense that written media

18
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:22,999
became less and less widespread. Important 
mass communication channels were

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,466
instead oral or figurative in nature. Town criers, 
architecture, statues and religious art

20
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:36,832
were still used to reach a large audience. Coins 
were other examples of visual media

21
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:41,933
that communicated something, typically who 
was in charge at a certain time. 

22
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:41,966


23
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:45,999
The channels of choice were well suited for 
communicating who was in power and

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,966
and how citizens should behave. 

25
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:52,699
We know the church played an important part in 
this and worked hand in hand

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,233
with worldly leaders to get this message 
through. 

27
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,566
Often there were agreements between rulers and 
clergymen that at the end

28
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:04,866
or start of the Sunday mass more worldly news 
on taxes, wars 

29
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:11,132
and basically everything citizens should know, 
was communicated to the assembled people.

30
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:14,933
Since most people went to church, this was for 
centuries a very effective method

31
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,233
to get a message out amongst the people

32
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:23,633
if the need arose. Other media also focused on 
visual and oral communication.

33
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:28,533
Plays and theatre still existed but theatres did 
not hold the audiences

34
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:31,433
of thousands as they did in Classical times.

35
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:36,133
Although written media had almost disappeared 
as a means of mass communication,

36
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:42,033
printed pamphlets with etchings or other 
figurative depictions were sometimes used. 

37
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:45,799
Some people might think: they printed 
pamphlets? Havenât we learned

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,766
that the printing press was invented in the 
fifteenth century by Johannes Gutenberg? 

39
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:53,666
Well, actually, the printing press already existed 
long before this time.

40
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,966
However, it was quite expensive to print 
something because 

41
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:01,366
basically every page had to be carved out in 
wood, stone or metal. 

42
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:05,199
Because the potential audience that was able to 
read and pay was small,

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,633
it was usually simply not worth it. So what was 
this printing innovation of Gutenberg

44
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:16,299
that everyone always puts so much emphasis 
on? It was actually the very cunning 

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,500
introduction of the clichÃ©, a small letter that 
could be put in a box

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,966
to make words and sentences. 

47
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,799
When the printing was done, the box was 
emptied 

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,966
and new words and pages could be formed.

49
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:31,232
This innovation made it much quicker and 
cheaper to print texts

50
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:34,966
and is therefore rightly credited as a turning 
point in European history 

51
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:40,332
and a huge catalyst for the Renaissance. Of 
course this technical revolution would probably 

52
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,633
never have had a huge impact if there hadnât 
been an audience to read and buy books at the

53
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:49,933
same time, which was the result of several long 
and complicated historical trends

54
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:56,566
towards a higher alfabecy level and the rise of a 
potential audience with buying power. 

55
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,999
Not coincidentally while the mass 
communication landscape

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,533
started to flourish again with the rise of print 
media, 

57
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,933
scholars again started to discuss the topic of 
communication on a meta level.

58
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,599
So started the Renaissance, not only of art, 
science and literature,

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,666
but also of our scientific discipline.
