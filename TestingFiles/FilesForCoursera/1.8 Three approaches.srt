00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:14,332
Weâve made a very broad distinction between 
three perspectives on our field.

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,833
The first approach is the linear transmission 
perspective.

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:22,233
Correct communication in this perspective 
causes the desired effect.

4
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,733
Therefore this approach tends to focus on 
effects of communication.

5
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:30,466
The second approach sees communication as 
the production and exchange of meanings.

6
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:33,632
It is concerned with the construction of 
messages using signs,

7
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,833
and the process of extracting meaning from 
these messages, called signification.

8
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:42,833
The interpretation of communication can lead to 
different but equally valid outcomes.

9
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:47,499
The third approach looks at how we use 
communication to construct our social reality.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,233
It examines the many ways we connect with 
people around us, by constantly sharing ideas 

11
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:57,733
and thereby constructing, reinforcing (or 
deconstructing) our identity. 

12
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:04,499
This perspective sees communication as the 
binding force of every society, group or culture. 

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,666
The potential to bind of course goes hand in 
hand with a potential for group deconstruction, 

14
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,399
audience fragmentation and cultural alienation. 

15
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:18,966
Obviously there are many more ways to 
distinguish schools of thought within our field. 

16
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,999
And I would like to point out that these 
categories are by no means fixed

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,900
or universally agreed upon.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,333
But for this introductory course I will use these 
basic perspectives as a useful tool

19
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,966
to categorize some of our more widely used 
theories and models.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,566
In the following week I will go back in time to 
talk with you

21
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,832
a bit about the history of communication 
science. 

22
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:43,766
Then we will discuss in each week after that, 
one of the three basic perspectives, 

23
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:45,199


24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,966
the linear effect oriented approach, the reception 
or signification approach 

25
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,932
and the cultural approach. 

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,500
If you want to know more about the topics we 
discussed this week, there are links to 

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,066
further readings, movies, and websites in the 
online environment of this MOOC. 

28
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:06,066
Also, try to test your recall by answering some 
multiple choice questions

29
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:09,066
and join the discussion on our online forum.

30
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,232
I hope to see you next week!
