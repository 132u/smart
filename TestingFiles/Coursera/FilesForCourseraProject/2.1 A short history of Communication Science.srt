00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,099
Welcome in week 2 of our MOOC.   

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,333
I hope you've enjoyed our format. I also hope 
you've done some of the self-evaluation tests

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:23,666
that we made available and checked out the 
further readings section in the online portal.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:30,666
Since we only discuss most theories very 
briefly, this is a good chance to explore them 
further.

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:37,266
Also, visit the forum. I'll often help out by posting 
answers to recurring questions here.

6
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,732
And let us know what you think of our MOOC.

7
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,466
All feedback is welcome.

8
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,066


9
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:43,399


10
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:44,799


11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,900
This week weâre going to talk about the history 
of communication science

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,666
 and Iâd like to stress that last part. 

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,632
Because weâre going to talk about when people 
started talking

14
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,899
and especially writing about communication. 

15
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:55,999


16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,266
So even though we could talk for hours about 
the presumed communication methods of 

17
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,266
prehistoric man and ancient civilizations after 
that,

18
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:06,332
about the earliest forms of communication, 
theories on the development of language, 

19
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,766
the introduction of mediated communication, 

20
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,299
through symbolism in rock art and figurines and 
such,

21
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:12,433


22
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,333
we are not going to do so. 

23
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:18,733
We are not going to discuss the oldest musical 
instruments or the first writing weâve found,

24
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:23,299
nor the power of communication through 
architecture and useable items like coins.  

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
Почему? 

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,666
Because we have no record that these 
civilizations thought

27
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,699
about communication on a meta level 

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,100
and constructed theories about itâs existence or 
use. 

29
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:32,866


30
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:35,766
Instead weâre going to start our journey here in 
Ancient Greece. 

31
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:38,799
Because the writings of the Ancient Greeks and 
after that the Romans 

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,666
are the oldest books about our topic to survive. 

33
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:43,666


34
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,332
After covering the earliest Communication 
Science of the Greeks and Romans 

35
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,333
weâll talk about Medieval times.

36
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,433
A time when there was little to no 
Communication Science. 

37
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:57,033
Then we'll discuss the printing revolution and the 
Renaissance of our field. 

38
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,233
Weâll end this week's MOOC with the nineteenth 
century,

39
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:04,033
industrialization, political change and the 
changing communication landscape.

40
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:07,899
Next week weâll continue with twentieth century 
communication theory.
