1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,166
What exactly is communication?

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,866
The most simple definition: Communication is 
each act of transmitting information. 

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:19,699
Information in the broadest sense of the word: 
including thoughts, ideas and emotions.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,300
Information in the broadest sense of the word: 
including thoughts, ideas and emotions.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,566
Information in the broadest sense of the word: 
including thoughts, ideas and emotions.

6
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:25,566
Giving someone a bouquet of flowers is 
communicating a certain message.

7
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,232
Adding to that gift a verbal compliment, 

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:31,633
"You're pretty" is another separate act of 
communication.

9
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,633
Blushing 'because you've just received flowers 
and a compliment

10
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,133
is again another form of communication.

11
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:37,999
is again another form of communication.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,266
is again another form of communication.

13
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:40,832
As social animals we communicate day in day 
out...

14
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:45,899
with spoken words, non-verbal gestures, signs 
and symbols.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,900
with spoken words, non-verbal gestures, signs 
and symbols.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,033


17
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,499
Sometimes we use media to communicate a 
message. 

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,266
Media are the channels that we use to 
communicate. 

19
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:55,499
Scholars donât really agree on the definition of 
the word media. 

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,300
Television, internet, radio, mobile phones, the 
soapbox we stand on to give a speech, 

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,700
they are all technical media in a way. Things we 
constructed to amplify our communication.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,433
In the more broader definition, we can include 
our hands, voice and eyes,

23
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:16,833
that we all use to communicate somehow, in the 
list of communication channels, of media.

24
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,766
In general however, whenever we discuss 
mediated communication

25
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:23,432
or the mass media, we only mean the first 
category. 

26
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,099


27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,133


28
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:30,566
Over the years scientists from different scientific 
disciplines have studied these channels

29
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:34,132
of communication and all these different forms 
that communication can take.

30
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,499
The results of their studies have formed the 
basis of the relatively new

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,566
'science of communication'.

32
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,866
Even today, many scholars in other disciplines

33
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:45,266
study the exact same communication 
phenomena as we do.

34
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:50,566
We share theories, models and often use the 
same methods to analyse & describe our field.

35
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:54,566
It is therefore useful to be aware of how these 
other disciplines are connected with ours.

36
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,932


37
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,166
To get an idea of the different levels of 
communication

38
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,099
and how they are connected to other scientific 
disciplines,

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,566
we can look at the so-called pyramid of 
communication.

40
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,433


41
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:10,533
On the highest level of this pyramid we find 
societal communication,

42
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:15,333
which is by its very nature aimed at a large 
mass audience.

43
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:21,566
Therefore mainly historians, political scientists 
and sociologists studied this perspective.

44
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:24,132
Under that is the level of institutional 
communication,

45
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:30,866
that is performed by political parties, organized 
religions, large corporations and such.

46
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:33,532
Then comes the level of group communication. 

47
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,233
Groups are audiences that feel a high level of 
group identification,

48
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,166
for instance a family or a fanclub.

49
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,166
Both institutional and group communication are 
in the field of sociology

50
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,532
and cultural anthropology.

51
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,833
We have now arrived to the level of interpersonal 
communication,

52
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,233
basically the communication between two or 
more people.

53
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:58,999
Both sociologists and psychologists study this 
field.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,433
Finally there is the level of intrapersonal 
communication.

55
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,266
This would be the communication you have with 
yourself.

56
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:10,432
With this we mean all information processing, 
thinking, internalizing information

57
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:13,733
and the process of giving meaning to the world 
around us.

58
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,733
And of course this approach leans heavily on the 
discipline of psychology.
