00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,300
In the previous section we discussed the printing 
revolution. 

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,666
Shortly after the innovations by Gutenberg, 

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:19,732
millions and later billions of printed copies 
spread out through Europe. 

4
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,966
Not only books rolled of the presses. 

5
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,899
Especially short books and leaflets, collectively 
named pamphlets, 

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,033
were printed to entertain, persuade and inform 
readers.

7
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:34,799
From the sixteenth century these pamphlets 
were in many ways the new mass medium, 

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,500
giving information and opinion on current affairs, 
spreading the news

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,600
and commentary on that news throughout 
Europe.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
It was through pamphlets that many religious 
and political debates were fought out.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,200
It was pamphlets that informed multitudes about 
great military victories and defeats,

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,366
about the gossip that surrounded the European 
royal houses. 

13
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:58,199
Pamphlets had many styles. They could be 
serious or very funny. 

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,166
They were written for the learned and those who 
could hardly read, and everyone in between. 

15
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,966
In sixteenth century Venice the first newspaper 
was published, 

16
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,999
and quickly after this also German, Dutch and 
English newspapers appeared.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,733
But these newspapers didnât reach a mass 
audience, 

18
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,599
as they remained for a long time a medium for 
the elite, 

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,733
with a small readership and focus on foreign 
political news. 

20
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:26,733
Pamphlets, however, discussed foremost 
domestic and even local news. 

21
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,266
Readership could be quite high and there is a lot 
of evidence that suggests

22
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:34,666
they were read out loud in market places and in 
taverns for people who couldnât read.

23
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:39,799
Illustrations and attention gaining covers further 
added to their popular appeal.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,866
This graph shows that, in the Dutch Republic, 

25
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:47,566
every newsworthy event or crisis was 
accompanied by hundreds of pamphlets.

26
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,899
The first peaks are important moments in the 
Eighty-Years War (1568-1648) 

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,800
in which the Dutch won their independence from 
Spain. Later we see that hundreds of pamphlets

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,033
were published when the Republic was attacked 
from three sides, 

29
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:03,399
By France, MÃ¼nster and Cologne at the same 
time in 1672. 

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,933
A hateful pamphlet campaign put the blame at 
the feet of two leading politicians, 

31
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:11,099
which led to their deaths at a public lynching.

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,466
Historical evidence suggests that political 
enemies of these politicians 

33
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,099
were actually behind the smear campaign that 
led to their deaths.

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,933
Examples like these showed contemporary 
scholars the powers of mass communication.

35
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,933
It clearly paid off to heed public opinion and to 
be able to use mass media

36
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:32,433
like the influential pamphlet press. Scholars like 
NiccolÃ² Machiavelli 

37
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:36,399
approached the topic of mass communication 
from this political power angle,

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,766
using elements from antiquity and combining 
these with new ideas. 

39
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,999
This approach was the starting point of a truly 
modern communication science. 

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,366
Weâll look at how that evolved in the next and 
final section of this week.
