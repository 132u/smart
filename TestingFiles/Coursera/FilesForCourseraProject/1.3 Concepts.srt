1
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:14,799
Weâve just seen that different scientific 
disciplines all study communication. 

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,733
Of course they focus on different aspects of 
communication.

3
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,899
Some scholars want to understand the workings 
of the media infrastructure for instance,

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,600
others focus on the social importance of 
communication, or

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,566
political communication effects or one of many 
alternative perspectives.

6
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:35,232
Itâs not surprising that communication is studied 
by so many from so many angles.

7
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:40,066
It fills our lives & society, we spend tremendous 
amounts of time communicating ideas,

8
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:46,099
sharing thoughts, absorbing new information, 
being entertained or persuaded somehow. 

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,033
Communication, simply put, enables us to 
function as social, cultural and political animals.

10
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,833


11
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,699
It makes sense that these different perspectives 
have led to a wide spectrum 

12
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,600
of scientific thought on the topic of 
communication.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,466
In this course weâll go out and explore some of 
them and try to find our way

14
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,499
in this wild jumble of theories, models and 
concepts.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Perhaps a good starting point therefore is to 
begin with a brief definition

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,733
of âtheoryâ, âmodelâ, and âconceptâ.

17
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,499


18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,866
A concept is a word or set of words that 
represents an idea.

19
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,766
Itâs of course important to clearly define the 
concepts we use.

20
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:25,566
Letâs take the concept of âidentityâ for instance.

21
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:29,766
Itâs easy to imagine two or more different 
interpretations

22
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:32,299
about what constitutes an identity

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,566
Is it how one views oneself, or perhaps we 
should also take into consideration

24
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:39,766
how one's identity is perceived by others.

25
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,166
Or is that particular concept better described 
perhaps with the word âimageâ?

26
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:44,232
Often scientists squabble over definitions, and 
rightly so,

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,233
Often scientists squabble over definitions, and 
rightly so,

28
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:52,099
because it should be clear what we talk about.

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,733
These discussions sometimes never stop, and 
why would they?

30
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,066
Different people give different meanings to a 
word,

31
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:00,166
and who can say which are the ârightâ or âwrongâ 
definitions?

32
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,966
At most we can speak about preferred or 
dominant definitions of concepts,

33
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:10,232
but even these usually change over time and 
from context to context.

34
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:14,233
In this course I will often stop to define certain 
key concepts.

35
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,533
I would like to stipulate that these definitions are 
unfortunately

36
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,433
more often than not quite disputed.

37
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:24,233
If you are following this MOOC and you had 
some previous classes in communication

38
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:28,399
or perhaps you have worked in communication 
or read books or articles about the topic

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,833
donât be surprised when I will define things 
slightly differently than you have learned.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,466
For instance, when I said that media are every 
channel that we use to communicate,

41
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:45,466
so this would include the voice, itâs very possible 
that you have learned previously 

42
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:50,032
that only technical channels are considered 
media, which would exclude the voice. 

43
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:55,566
Because both definitions, and many more, exist 
in the scientific field.

44
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,499


45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,133
To make things more difficult, scientists, like 
many professionals,

46
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:04,333
sometimes give every day words a different 
meaning.

47
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,699
If I would ask a random person in the street the 
definition of the word âtextâ, 

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,566
most will agree that a âtextâ is a message made 
up out of some type of letters. 

49
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:19,199
Communication scientists however regard each 
carrier of communication as a text.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,300
So a movie, a song, a painting, theyâre all âtextsâ 
in our eyes, ready to be âreadâ by an audience.
