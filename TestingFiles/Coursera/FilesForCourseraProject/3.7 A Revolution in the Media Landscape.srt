1
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:13,866
Earlier I pointed towards World War II as a

2
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:19,199
reason for the popular and scientific reluctance 
to accept a minimal effect conclusion.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,866
A second reason was the arrival of television in 
the 1950s and 1960s as a new medium

4
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:29,432
with even more power of attraction than its 
predecessors

5
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:35,033
The effects of television were presumed huge, 
but not in the old 'magic bullet' way.

6
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:38,399
Not so much direct, short term, and uniform, but

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,166
1) Long term, with repeated exposure.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:46,332
One new theory called cultivation proposed that 
after repeated long term exposure

9
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:51,899
audiences tend to shift towards the dominant 
media viewpoints on matters.

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,266
2) Indirect effects, much more attention was 
given now to

11
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:58,266
indirect effects like associated effects.

12
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,999
For instance, when we see a commercial of a 
muscular man eating ice cream we might not

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,933
run in to the shop to immediately buy ice cream. 
But perhaps after several commercials like this,

14
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:15,266
we will associate this particular brand with a 
healthy appearance,

15
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:19,632
thereby increasing the likelihood that weâll prefer 
this brand.

16
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:24,433
These types of effects are also typically longer 
lasting that the magic bullet

17
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,433
and hypodermic needle effects.

18
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:32,333
3) Personal effects. Now it was appreciated that 
one audience member

19
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,266
is not the same as the other.

20
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:38,732
Effects therefore are pluriform and have to be 
studied in context. A violent cartoon 

21
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:42,333
might have a completely different effect on a 
child that watches it alone

22
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:46,833
than on a child that watches it with siblings or 
parents. 

23
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,133
4) Reinforcement rather than change.

24
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:54,733
Studies increasingly indicate that reinforcement 
effects are quite strong,

25
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,266
people remember and process content 
selectively,

26
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:00,766
based on their own knowledge and 
predispositions.

27
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:06,966
Therefore things that connect with their preferred 
reality will sooner be processed.

28
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:11,366
A topic that weâll discuss more in length in the 
next week by the way.

29
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:14,732
Television was in many ways a new platform:

30
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:19,733
it captivated its audience, created new worlds 
within a media reality.

31
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:25,999
Television shows had a huge impact. Unlike the 
paper, people watched television together, 

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,700
so in many ways it was a social medium as 
well.

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,500
It was also topic for discussion.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,633
You could quickly isolate yourself if you werenât 
aware of new programs and shows on television. 

35
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,699
Hypermediality, when people reference media 
content, 

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,900
became one way of opening yourself up or 
closing yourself of to a group. 

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,800
We can imagine the new co-worker

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,966
who is the only one who hasnât seen a new 
series on television. 

39
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:56,266
Heâll probably feel as though heâs less part of 
the group now.

40
00:02:56,266 --> 00:03:00,799
And you know, to some extent, this is true.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Television became a preferred way to spend 
time, alone or together.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,300
Shows and series were a way to identify 
yourself, as an audience member

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,500
or even as a fan of that particular program

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,200
Social Learning, when people learn skills or how 
to behave in situations in a social setting,

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,166
proved to be quite effective through television. 

46
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:26,666
Even though I have never been in a fire, I have 
some idea what to do and avoid, 

47
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:32,932
because of many movies and series. If these 
ideas are correct of course, remains to be seen,

48
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:36,199
but I do have some inkling based on media 
exposure.

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Just like I think I know what to expect in a 
courtroom, space shuttle, or dinosaur attack. 

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,833
Not because of direct experience, but through 
mediated experience.

51
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:52,066
Other scholars established Socialization Effects 
for television. 

52
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:57,199
Socialization is when we learn norms and values 
in a informal way.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,666
Just like we learn from our parents, family, and 
friends, we learn from television as well.

54
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,999
All of these effects were probably not unique for 
television compared to other media,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,166
but they were very apparent in television.

56
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:16,732
It was probably the rise of television more than 
anything that caused the final paradigm,

57
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:20,366
a compromise between minimal and powerful 
effects.

58
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:25,266
This is the dominant paradigm of today, that of 
negotiated media effects.
