1
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:16,699
During the sixties critics stood up, they objected 
against this linear effect-oriented approach

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,900
They argued that many people give a different 
meaning to a message than was intended,

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,633
but why should that be wrong?

4
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,866
Instead, they focused on the recipients of 
communication

5
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:32,132
and how they give meaning to a message, using 
their own unqiue toolkit

6
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:38,333
with their own backgrounds and experiences, 
knowledge, emotions, et cetera.

7
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:43,399
So in this model, this non-linear model, there is 
no wrong outcome,

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,666
there is no wrong communication

9
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,499
Everyone gives meaning to a message in there 
own unique way

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,400
This idea was hardly new.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,300
Scientists had studied the phenomenon of 
polysemic messages for a long time. 

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,333
Polysemic meaning exactly that, different 
people interpreting a message in a different way.  

13
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:03,333
According to these scientists each act of 
communication relies

14
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,366
on a communication system, without which we 
wouldn't understand each other.  

15
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,899
The study of these systems iscalled semiotics or semiology,

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,433
the so called study of âsignsâ and âsignificationâ.

17
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:16,666
A sign is basically everything that 
communicates something. 

18
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,866
A spoken word, a gesture, a glance, a photo, a 
cartoon,

19
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:23,366
a written sentence, a hieroglyph, they are all 
signs. 

20
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:27,366
The process of giving meaning to these signs is 
called signification. 

21
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:31,766
Without going to deep into this fascinating topic, 
itâs important to briefly discuss 

22
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:35,232
the influence of semiotic theories on mass 
communication theory. 

23
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:40,633
This approach views communication not as a 
linear process but as an exchange of meaning.

24
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:46,299
The sender puts meaning in a message and the 
receiver takes meaning from a message.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,500
Under influence of semiotic theories,

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,766
communication scientists became more 
interested in the reception of a message

27
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:56,399
and acknowledged that communication can 
indeed have multiple valid outcomes.  

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,966
Letâs look at this classic model for example,

29
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:02,232
proposed by linguist Roman Jacobson in 1960.

30
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:06,233
He starts with familiar elements from Shannon 
and Weavers transmission model: 

31
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:10,233
An addresser sends a message to an 
addressee using a channel. 

32
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,799
He added to the model elements from semiotics   

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,500
Like the idea that every message refers to 
something outside of the message,

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,466
which he called context. 

35
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:22,932
Also, the specific form that our communication 
takes, for instance a written word,

36
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,466
 made up of letters, is called a code.  

37
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:30,132
Successful communication, according to 
Jacobson,

38
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,933
can only exist when all of these elements are in 
place. 

39
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:37,433
Also, each act of communication has one 
dominant function

40
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:42,066
that relates to one of these elements in this 
model. 

41
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,899
Let's review these functions that Jacobson 
identified. 

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,900
When the primary purpose of a message is to 
communicate

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,633
the emotions and attitudes of a sender, this is 
called the emotive function. 

44
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,533
For instance when I write a love letter to my 
girlfriend.

45
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,733
The second function is conative. 

46
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,833
If a receiver is directly addressed to do 
something specific.

47
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:07,766
An example is a commercial that tells us to 
âbuy this flavour of ice cream!â. 

48
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:11,499
The referential or descriptive function 
corresponds with the context 

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,200
and happens when a message primarily 
describes a situation.

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,533
Perhaps a news report is a good example for 
this. 

51
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:22,299
Sometimes the main purpose of communicating 
is to keep the lines open, 

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,300
when we have coffee each week with a friend for 
instance. 

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,000
This is called a phatic function and relates to the 
channel. 

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,600
A poetic function means that the message is an 
end in itself,

55
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,266
a painting for example that aims at being a 
beautiful and aesthetically pleasing piece of art.

56
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,299
And finally there is the metalingual function,

57
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,200
when we use communication to explain the 
codes that we use. 

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,233
For instance a dictionary. 

59
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,499
Another example is the explanation Iâm giving 
right now,

60
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,000
in which we are discussing concepts from the 
field of semiotics.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,833
By focusing on the meaning of a message, 

62
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,699
signs, signification and the main function of a 
message, 

63
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,433
Jacobson has given us a model that is very 
different from the transmission model. 

64
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:05,299
Itâs also a good starting point to discuss a third 
perspective

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,333
that offers again a new angle with which to view 
our field.
