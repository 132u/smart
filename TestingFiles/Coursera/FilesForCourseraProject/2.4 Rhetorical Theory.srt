1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,633
In the Art of Rhetoric

2
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,899
Aristotle somewhat bridged the gap between the 
sophist and dialectic method. 

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,833
As a student of Plato he was well versed in the 
use of the dialectic method

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,599
or rational argumentation. 

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,566
But he did not share Platoâs dislike of rhetorica 

6
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,866
and he wrote an extensive treatise on persuasive 
theory. 

7
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:32,332
In which rational arguments definitely played an 
important, but not an exclusive part.

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,299
Aristotle focuses on the sender aspect of 
communication

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,033
and he uses a simple model to explain the 
different stages of sending out a message.

10
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,699
First of all, the topic of the message is 
determined.  

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,700
This is the invention stage of communication.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,533
Then the style of the message is determined. 

13
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:55,799
Thirdly and finally the message will be delivered. 

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,866
A politician might have a topic she wants to talk 
about. 

15
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,866
She will then choose her words carefully, 

16
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,632
what tone should she use? 

17
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:05,866
And thirdly, she'll choose the manner of delivery,

18
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,132
she might choose to publish a pamphlet or give 
a speech. 

19
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,299
Letâs say she gives a speech. 

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,200
Now comes the stage of delivery: 

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,300
she will use her stage performance, 

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,800
her gestures and intonation,

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,566
 to strengthen her message. 

24
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:24,199
Successful communication, which leads to 
persuasion, has three building blocks:

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,766
Logos, Ethos, Pathos.

26
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:32,399
Logos is the use of reason. Basically it 
resembles what Socrates and Plato taught:

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,500
rational arguments based on facts and logic. 

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,633
Our politician for instance might use some 
statistics to back up her argument.

29
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:46,566
Ethos is the âcharacterâ or more precise the 
perceived trustworthiness,

30
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,666
likeability and intelligence of the sender. 

31
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:53,532
Many persuasive arguments focus on personal 
traits like this. 

32
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:57,999
Our politician might try to convince us that we 
should listen to her because

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,800
she is the expert on this field. 

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,133
Without rational backing, this is a so-called 
authority argument. 

35
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:08,633
Or she will tell her audience âwhen have I ever 
lied to you?â

36
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:12,966
thereby making it a trust issue and trying to 
increase her own credibility. 

37
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,699
Or she will try to attack the trustworthiness of 
her opponents.

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,266
Or try to gain sympathy by hugging a child in 
front of an audience.

39
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:25,766
This has little to do with rational persuasion but 
might be very effective nevertheless. 

40
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:30,566
Under pathos fall all other emotional appeals, 
that try to make the audience feel something. 

41
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:35,832
For instance by appealing to fears, hopes, likes, 
dislikes or sense of humor. 

42
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:42,099
Aristotle tells us to do this by using stories, 
examples and exaggeration. 

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,600
Next to Aristotle the most noteworthy classical 
scholar whose writings survived the ages

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,866
was the Roman lawyer, senator, governor and 
consul Marcus Tullius Cicero. 

45
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:57,332
Cicero whose speeches and treatises have been 
studied throughout the ages 

46
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,766
by students of history and communication.

47
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:03,566
The same speeches that gained him so much 
power in the Roman Republic

48
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:08,566
and allies like Octavian, who later became the 
first Emperor of Rome.

49
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:12,866
They also gained him dangerous enemies, like 
the general Marc Anthony.

50
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:19,299
And in the end it was this enmity that caused 
his decapitation during the Roman civil war. 

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,933
His powers of communication had been such a 
thorn in his enemies eyes,

52
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,099
that killing him wasnât enough.

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,300
When his head was displayed in Rome,

54
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,533
they stuck needles in his tongue to punish it for 
all the harm it had done.   

55
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,966
You can pick up recent translations of Ciceroâs 
books,

56
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,232
like De Inventione, on the invention stage of 
communication, 

57
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,066
De Oratore, about the delivery, 

58
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:48,366
or the popular handbook Rhetorica ad 
Herennium in most book shops today.

59
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,666
And recognize that even though its written two 
millennia ago,

60
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,266
most of the theories are still applicable today.

61
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:57,966
An anecdote about Cicero for instance tells us 
that he would sometimes

62
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:01,532
purposely drop his papers while walking to the 
speeching area. 

63
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:07,733
His audience then would feel sympathy because 
this âaccidentâ could also happen to them. 

64
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:12,799
He seemed more human and fallible and 
therefore more likeable to them.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,133
It was little tricks like this, that made him such 
a good orator. 

66
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:22,099
So rhetorical theory combined larger meta 
models on communication 

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,500
with 'smaller' practical tips on how to achieve 
these goals,

68
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,633
how to seem right, or believable, nice, intelligent 
et cetera.

69
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:35,433
In short, there was a lively academic and widely 
practiced communication science

70
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,966
in the classical world. 

71
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:41,966
As years went by and the Roman Empire 
collapsed in to the dark Middle Ages

72
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:47,832
these ideas all but disappeared to the cellars of 
monasteries, and libraries of Eastern scholars.

73
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,633
 If they survived at all.
