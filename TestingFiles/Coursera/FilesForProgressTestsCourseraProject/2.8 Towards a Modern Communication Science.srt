1
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:14,066
We have strolled with huge steps through the 
history of communication science 

2
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,399
starting in the sixth century BC,

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,733
 through Antiquity,

4
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,366
the Middle Ages

5
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,932
 the Renaissance 

6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:23,299
and into Early Modern times. 

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,733
The nineteenth century is often seen as the 
starting point of modern times

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:34,299
and characterized by industrialization, the rise of 
nationalism, birth of political parties,

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,733
birth of socialism and subsequent emancipation 
of the masses. 

10
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:46,399
The rise of the media as a social-political and 
financial power is closely connected to this. 

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,466
The media were able to influence, make people 
rich and form or break communities.

12
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:55,866
Letâs briefly go over nineteenth century thought 
on this.

13
00:00:55,866 --> 00:01:00,166
First of all we should recognize that despite the 
power and influence of mass media

14
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:05,866
in former times, all of this increased 
substantially in the nineteenth century. 

15
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,432
Since much more people were able to read and 
write,

16
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:12,133
the potential audience for print media grew 
enormously. 

17
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:16,199
At the same time, new print technologies and 
methods for making paper 

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,000
made it easier and cheaper to produce books, 
pamphlets, magazines and newspapers.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,466
Simply put, it became more profitable to cater to 
the tastes of a mass audience 

20
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:31,732
and therefore literature specifically designed for 
popular tastes was booming. 

21
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,633
Special magazines for women, books for 
children, 

22
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,966
newspapers for members of a political party, 

23
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:40,399
pamphlets aiming at villagers in one specific 
village:

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,066
it was all becoming part of daily reality. 

25
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,932
Most noticeably was the transition from 
pamphlets 

26
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:50,166
as the primary print medium for news and 
debate,

27
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,566
to newspapers. 

28
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:56,332
Although they had existed for a long time, it was 
only in the nineteenth century

29
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,466
that newspapers started to cater to a popular 
audience, 

30
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,999
hence becoming a true mass medium.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,866
The new newspaper followed the journalistic 
format set out by press barons 

32
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:11,632
like William Stead, Joseph Pulitzer and 
Randolph Hearst 

33
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:15,566
in which the news had to be interesting and 
attention gaining. 

34
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:19,266
New genres like the reportage, cartoon, 
illustration 

35
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:23,032
and later the photo, the column, featured article 
and interview 

36
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,133
were quickly adopted throughout the world. 

37
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,933
Financing of the paper also changed: 

38
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:32,099
the old newspaper was often dependent on 
payment from the government,

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,566
for which they promised to publish 
announcements. 

40
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:39,199
The new newspaper wanted a large audience 
since they got heir money from sales

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,133
and advertisements revenue.

42
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:46,266
It was less dependent and therefore often more 
critical of the government

43
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,232
and did its best to entertain, opiniate and inform 
on all matters, 

44
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,799
not only political. 

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,466
Crime, agriculture, sports, theater, music, 
household appliances,

46
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:02,366
they were now all part of the weekly â and when 
the appearance rate increased - daily news.

47
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,032
Because of these changes, 

48
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,733
more media, new audience groups 

49
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,933
and new technologies that made printing easier 
and cheaper, 

50
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:13,299
the media landscape became an economic force 
to be reckoned with. 

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,233
But also politically the importance of mass 
communication increased 

52
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:20,399
and the attitude of politicians changed.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,233
In the previous section I explained that scholars 
started to argue for rulers

54
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:29,866
to be more attentive to public opinion and the 
power of mass communication.                                    

55
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:33,366
At first the idea behind this was purely 
pragmatic.

56
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:36,532
But later, it was connected to the Enlightened 
democratic ideal 

57
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:41,433
that governments are for the people, and 
therefore should listen to the people. 

58
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,866
New political theories proposed that the 
government

59
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:47,999
was in some sense made up of representatives 
of the people. 

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,933
Mass media were not only a way to influence 
those people, 

61
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:53,066
but also a reflection of public opinion,

62
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,466
and a check on the misuse of power by the 
government

63
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,299
Itâs important to note that scholarly thought 

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,700
had now evolved to the point

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,766
that all the different channels of mass 
communication were now collectively labeled

66
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,866
as being part of one political institute.

67
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:13,566
In the nineteenth century this institute began to 
be referred to as âThe Fourth Estateâ.

68
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,266
A term coined by Edmund Burke. 

69
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:20,899
Media as âThe Fourth Estateâ are instrumental 
for any nation, 

70
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,766
because they function firstly as a channel 
between government and people, 

71
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,599
secondly as a barometer of public opinion,

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,300
and thirdly as a check on the use of power by 
rulers. 

73
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,966
The lesson that it paid to listen to your citizens 
was driven home quite dramatically

74
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:39,832
with the French Revolution in 1789

75
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:45,233
when the masses rose and executed king Louis 
XVI and many French nobles. 

76
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,666
We can only imagine the shock that went 
through Europe

77
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,799
as this set a dangerous precedent. 

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Weâll not go in to the historical ramifications of 
the French Revolution. 

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,300
But itâs enough to note that the subsequent 
nineteenth century 

80
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,733
saw many concessions toward democratic 
ideals in most European countries.

81
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,533
The attitude towards mass communication 
changed as well. 

82
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:10,699
The idea grew that media had a political power 
to be either feared or harnessed. 

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,266
Before the nineteenth century, 

84
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:17,066
legislation in many countries had been aimed at 
controlling the media landscape, 

85
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,666
punishing authors that criticized the government, 

86
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:25,299
banning pamphlets, books or newspapers that 
were deemed politically or religiously subversive. 

87
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,900
However, these measures proved unsuccessful 

88
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,833
as forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest 

89
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:37,099
and authors were able to move and get their 
work printed in other countries relatively easy. 

90
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,800
The Dutch Republic for example was for many a 
place

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,266
where basically everything could be published, 

92
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:46,532
as long as you kept friendly towards the cityâs 
government ofcourse. 

93
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,066
In the nineteenth century

94
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,699
most countries changed their stance towards 
media governance. 

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,633
They actually adopted âThe Fourth Estateâ 
principle in their legislation

96
00:05:55,633 --> 00:06:00,066
when they explicitly promised freedom of the 
press in their constitutions. 

97
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,432
Journalists at the same time gained higher 
status, 

98
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:07,133
receiving for instance special clearance to be at 
government meetings.

99
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,599
Politicians started to make more and more use 
of the powers of the Fourth Estate

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,300
instead of trying to suppress it.

101
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,633
Political campaigns were now becoming media 
scripted events.

102
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:22,333
Important politicians also had close ties with 
newspapers.

103
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,666
Often as editor-in-chief or financial backer.

104
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,232
At the end of the nineteenth century, 

105
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,899
the mass media were widely acknowledged  

106
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,933
as an economically, politically and socially 
powerful institute. 

107
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,466
Scholarly thought now recognized mass 
communication

108
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,399
as an integral part of our society. 

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,900
The stage was set for the further development of 
scientific thought 

110
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,200
on communication in the twentieth century.

111
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,066
Weâll talk about that topic next week.

112
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,766
 I hope to see you then.
