00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,199
Welcome to the course Introduction to 
Communication Science.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,466
My name is dr. Rutger de Graaf and I'm a 
lecturer here

3
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,732
at the University of Amsterdam, the departement 
of Communication Science.

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:21,399
We're standing in the beautiful courtyard of the 
17th century headquarters of

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,866
the Dutch East India Company.

6
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,666
'Het Oost-Indisch huis'.

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:30,899
In this historical landmark, over 150 scientists 
study and teach the science of communication.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,300


9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,200
This course is a so called MOOC. This is a new 
trend of online courses,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,700
initially designed by Stanford and MIT. MOOC 
stands for Massive Open Online Course.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,300
It's massive in the sense that it's open to a 
potentially much larger audience

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,633
than our normal courses, which are of course 
limited to the available space in a classroom.

13
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:56,466
A MOOC is completely open, which means it's 
free of costs and designed so that everyone,

14
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:01,366
also without any specific experience in the field, 
can enter.

15
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:01,666


16
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,432


17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,533
Finally, all our lectures, class materials, self- 
evaluations tests and exams, 

18
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,099
will be available through an online portal.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,866
This of course, gives new options to our 
teaching environment.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,533


21
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,766
For instance, you can download all captions.

22
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:20,666
Also, additional links and tips for further content 
will be offered at the end of each class.

23
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,732
Also, additional links and tips for further content 
will be offered at the end of each class.

24
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:27,633
Next to this, there's a small community in which 
you can ask questions or share your thoughts.

25
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:30,066
And to test your recall and understanding of 
each topic,

26
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:34,132
I'll often add some multiple choice questions 
that you can use for self evaluation.

27
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:34,933


28
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,699
We will cover some of the basic theories, 
models and concepts

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,766
from the field of communication.

30
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:45,399
On this first class I'll talk about the scope of our 
field, what exactly is communication? 

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,566
and how does our discipline relate to other 
studies, like sociology and psychology.

32
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,499
and how does our discipline relate to other 
studies, like sociology and psychology.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,500
In future weeks we'll discuss the history of 
communication theory.

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,766
Obvisiously, people have been communicating 
since the dawn of men,

35
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:00,966
but when and why did communication theory 
arise?

36
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,499
but when and why did communication theory 
arise?

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,600
but when and why did communication theory 
arise?

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,633
After that, we'll use three dominant approaches 
to the field to discuss our topic further.

39
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:11,066
First, we'll look at communication as a means of 
persuasion,

40
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:14,399
both from a political and a corporate angle.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,233
The second perspective is that of 
communication processing,

42
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:22,766
which is simply put 'how we give meaning to a 
message?'

43
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:28,066
The final part of this course will focus on social 
and cultural aspects of communication,

44
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:31,766
like group dynamics and audience formation.
