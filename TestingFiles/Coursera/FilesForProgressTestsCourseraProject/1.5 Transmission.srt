1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:13,299
When we talk about theories, the first theory to 
discuss, is the basic transmission model.

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,666
This model reflects dominant thought on 
communication,

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:21,599
by proposing communication as a linear process 
that starts with a sender, creates a message

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,966
and somehow ends up with an audience, a 
receiver.

5
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:29,032
Lasswell, in 1948, made this model explicit.

6
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:33,066
To understand the process of communication, 
according to Lasswell, we need to consider

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:38,632
Who, says What, in which Channel, to Whom, 
and with what Effect

8
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:42,633
Of course, many things can go wrong in this 
process of communication

9
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:46,866
When I talk to someone and a car drives by, it 
might cause a distraction

10
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:50,032
or its roaring engine might drown out my voice.

11
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,833
My conversation partner can have other things 
on his mind 

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:57,833
and there are many other things that can cause 
a disruption of effective communication

13
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:03,333
It's important to note, by the way, that 
communication, in this linear way of looking at 
communication

14
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,333
is only effective when the desired effect is 
reached.

15
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:13,099
When the message succesfully reaches, and is 
correctly interpreted by the receiver.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,433
That many things can distort a correct 
transmission becomes clear

17
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:20,966
in the transmission model, that Shannon and 
Weaver created in 1949.

18
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:25,766
This model of communication embodies five 
elements, like the model of Lasswell

19
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:31,666
The first element is Sender, which is obviously 
the person or persons, that create a message

20
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,199
Then comes the Message itself

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,866
Thirdly, the Channel that is used to send the 
message.

22
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,099
Another word for this channel is of course 
medium

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,100
and the different channels that exist are 
collectively named media.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,033
The next element is, like in the Lasswell model, 
the Receiver.

25
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,866
And finally again, we see the Effect.

26
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:53,299
Here we clearly see that in each of these stages 
so-called 'Noise'

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,166
can disrupt the correct transmission.

28
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,532
In our field we define noise as

29
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:01,099
'Everything that can cause a disruption in the 
flow of communication'.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,766
So, in our example, the car that passes by can 
create many forms of noise.

31
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:11,532
The sound of its loud engine causes confusion 
because someone can't hear me correctly

32
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,999
or miss what I'm saying entirely. So, that's one 
form of noise.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,633
Another form is the distraction that it creates for 
my partner

34
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,566
so he doesn't really pay attention to what I'm 
saying

35
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:26,899
and therefore misinterprets or forgets my 
message and the desired effect is not reached.

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,266
The important thing with these models is that 
they see communication as a linear process

37
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,699
and this in itself has led to an emphasis on 
effects.

38
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,100
We want to know if communication has a 
desired effect.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,433
This is a very influential way of looking at 
communication.

40
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:44,466
It's also very different from another approach that 
we will explain further

41
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,432
in the next section of this MOOC.
